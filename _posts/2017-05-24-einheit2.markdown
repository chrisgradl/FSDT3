# Online Session 2:

TBD...




<!--
### TASK 10:

In the next session we will use Node only on our local machines. Anyway we want to learn how we can deploy a node application to run in the www. We will use Heroku for it. It is a [PaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service). Platform as a Service. You can

- Create an account on [heroku](https://heroku.com)
- [Follow this tutorial](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#deploy-the-app)
- Finish until the step Deploy the App
- Check out the source code of the project. Looks this familiar to you?
- Create a file hello.html in the public folder
- add a h1 element with 'Hello + your name' as content
- return this html file for the base route '/' in your index.js
- go to the command line and type
  - `git add index.js`
  - `git add hello.html`
  - `git commit'
  - now you are in a text editor on the command line
  - press i (for insert)
  - type first commit
  - press esc
  - type :x!
- redeploy your application to heroku
- Check if your html site is returned on the url

We have successfully deployed a node application to the web

Why do we have to learn this? What has this to do with Sensors: In the next lesson we will connect the Arduino to our node application. Then we will read the data input from the arduino. If we have enough time we will display the sensor values on the heroku app.
